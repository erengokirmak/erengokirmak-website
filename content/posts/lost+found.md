description: how you lose sight, and how you gain it again
---

it is so easy to lose your dreams. the pieces of yourself that you wanted to carry, and make into your legacy. the things that make your life *yours*. sometimes i worry that i'm forgetting my dreams, letting them go. it is so easy to do that. to get carried in the motions of everyday life. forgetting to organize. forgetting to remember.

however, just as easy as it is to forget, you start anew. every morning, you wake up to take care of your body. *it* does not forget the desire to continue. youâ€¦remember things from your past, and bring them back into your future. your dreams don't need continuity. you are not a movie. but you *are* a story. a story that decides to rewrite itself from time to time. a story that dwells in the petty detail and the mundane stress. a story that sometimes needs room to breathe, and sometimes desperately needs something, *anything* to progress.

in the end, regardless of your path there, you can always get back on your dreams. they will be waiting for you.
