description: why distances matter, and why they sometimes do not
---

what is our obsession with wanting to be in-person? what difference does the body make when it's close to us?

friendships that go forgotten, only because a walking distance turns into a bus ride. relationships gone, for the warm hug is not there anymore. the easy access, turning into effort, turning into nothing at all.

but I have seen the distance not even making a dent on some. mails sent, not expecting a response for months on end, but still expecting an answer regardless. couples on airports, meeting at the first chance they have and having their moment of pure joy. friends, having never even met in person, relying on purely the acknowledgement that they have managed to keep a connection going for years on end. managing the make embrace of two minds more important than the embrace. trusting that you have someone on the other side of the world who's doing exactly the same thing. an unspoken trust.

i trust many people in my life. many of them are far away. still, I believe in their ability to uphold their promise of "until we meet again."

take care friend. until we meet againâ€¦
