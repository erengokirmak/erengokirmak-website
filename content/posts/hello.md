description: a quick summary of what i want to do with this blog
---

hello, i'm eren. <!--more--> don't mind the lack of uppercase letters, they are [There](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case).  right now, i only want to deal with plain-text as it is in my mind: rather calm and without much organization. they will probably come around for later posts.

i compiled this version of the site through [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). i'm still quite new to it but i feel like it could serve me well. i don't want to put too much effort into a static website designed to serve plain-text and images to viewers. anyway, the things you can expect to see in this blog are:

- poems
- ramblings about
  - mathematics
  - programming
  - academia
- life updates
- updates about personal projects
- photos i take (without metadata :p)

for now, that is all. hope you are doing well, wherever you are. take care.
